   - [ ] day2
   - [x] day3

 - [x] harmonize style / custom css ?

## outline
 - [ ] switch library loads & installs

## day 2
  - [x] relative path to data folder
  - [x] consolidate code w/ day1
  - [ ] rowsum filtering per 50% of samples, or rowsums > 10, or ?
  - [ ] rename images with day prefix
  - [ ] fix layout + images
  - [ ] get rid of knitr graphics and include directly as in day1/day3
  - [ ] tidyR everything.
  - [ ] layout table of contents + headers as in other days
  - [ ] factors, emphasise that this is for convenience.
  - [ ] no base plots, all ggplot2
  - [ ] dds vs dds_clean examples are not clear.
  - [ ] transformations -> normal, log & DESeq2, in heat maps instead of scatterplot
  - [ ] remove PCA's
  - [ ] include poll in poll everywhere
  - [ ] 4.1 start with excel table (in a diagram), then size factors, then compositional bias (https://www.biostars.org/p/83604/)
  - [ ] afterwards, modeling count data
  - [ ] finish with dispersion estimation
  - [ ] example of a bad disperion plot is not clear, e.g. subsample to very few counts and very high rRNA ?
  - [ ] shiny apps need URL 
  - [ ] example for clusterprofiler ?
  - [ ] no example for IPA
  - [ ] Poll 3.2 needs to go to day 2 !

## day 3

 - [ ] coef pngs -> ggplot them, colorcode doesn't make sense
 - [ ] recap should be bullet points rather then full re-explanation
 - [ ] wald test remove p adj values
 - [ ] tidy all
 - [ ] in get some results -> 2. contrasts and results, include the res as full class, not df as well (what comparison) ?
 - [ ] norm counts vs p value -> ggplot2
 - [ ] remove l2fc / p value plot
 - [ ] volcano plot '*' is not formatted properly
 - [ ] volcano plot is formatted a bit weird, perhaps with shrunk values ?
 - [ ] LRT == kmeans clustered !
 - [ ] Clean & Annotate: text to bullet points
 - [ ] Clean & Annotate: reformat task 

## day 4
 - [ ] compile
 - [ ] elaborate heatmaps + gene ontology
