# Goals:
# Apply what was learned through the course.
  # Initial QC and visualisation.
  # Run the DESeq workflow
  # Interpret some of the results.

Dataset: MPPs

Background:

We are looking in murine bone marrow cells. More specifically, the stem- and multipotent progenitor cells.
A (very expensive) experiment was set up, and there is RNA-seq data available three cellTypes:
 
 - HSCs
 - MPP1
 - MPP2

collected from both young and aged mice.
You and your lab are eager to see:

 - Did the experiment work ?
 - What are the effects of aging on the different cell populations ?


# add libraries
```{r add libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
.libPaths("/data/manke/processing/RdeseqEnv/R-4.0.3_Rcourse/lib64/R/library") 
library("DESeq2")
library("dplyr")
library("tibble")
library("ggplot2")
library("ggrepel")
library("pheatmap")
library("org.Mm.eg.db")
library("UpSetR")
```

Go through the whole setup.
