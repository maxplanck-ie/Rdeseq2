When dealing with count data, estimates for the median (e.g. $\lambda$) and fold changes are more noisy for low counts than estimates from high counts.

This can be illustrated by a simulation of four Poisson variables with
two different base counts, and with a fixed fold-change applied to both:

```{r simulation}
N=1000               
lam=c(low=2,high=20)  # lowly and highly expressed gene
fc=2                  # fix fold-change
pc=0                  # pseudo-count

dv=data.frame(low_b = rpois(N,lam["low"]), 
              low_a = rpois(N,fc*lam["low"]), 
              high_b = rpois(N, lam["high"]), 
              high_a = rpois(N,fc*lam["high"])
              )

dv$fc_low=(dv$low_a+pc) / (dv$low_b+pc)
dv$fc_high=(dv$high_a+pc) / (dv$high_b+pc)

br=seq(-6,6,by=0.1)
my_red=rgb(1,0,0,0.5)
my_blue=rgb(0,0,1,0.5)
hist(log2(dv$fc_low), breaks = br, col=my_blue, xlab="log2-FC", main="histogram of log2-FC")
hist(log2(dv$fc_high),breaks = br, col=my_red, add=TRUE)
abline(v=log2(fc), lwd=2)
legend("topright", c("low count", "high count"), col=c(my_blue, my_red), pch=15)
```
