# Goals: 

<!-- ![DESeq workflow](../images/workflow_DESeq2.png) -->

After the course you will be able to

* perform a full bioinformatics workflow (DESeq2): data input $\to$ output
* perform exploratory analysis: quality controls, filters
* visualize data and results with modern tools
* apply complex experimental designs
* use packages: to obtain differential genes
* share workflows with notebook

***

# Prerequistites
* R introdcution: data formats, functions, help, plotting, work with packages
* account for rstudio.ie-freiburg.mpg.de
* Patience

***

# Credits

 * !!! Leily, Mirela, Ward !!!
 
There is lots of useful material out there. This course is heavily influenced by those tutorials
