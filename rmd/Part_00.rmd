# Goals: 

<!-- ![Typical examples from R.](../images/DESeq2_workflow.png) -->

After the course you will be able to

* understand bioinformatics workflows: data input $\to$ output
* perform and understand quality controls
* visualize data and results
* apply complex experimental designs
* obtain differential genes
* share workflows with notebook

***

# Prerequistites
* R introdcution: data formats, functions, help, plotting, work with packages
* account for rstudio.ie-freiburg.mpg.de
* Patience

***

# Credits
There is lots of useful material out there. This course is heavily influenced by those tutorials

 * https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop_salmon_online/
