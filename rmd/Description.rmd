# Goals: 
The analysis of differential gene expression is a very common task for which many 
advanced software packages have been developed. 
At the example of DESeq, we will introduce common analyses and strategies to conduct this analysis using R.
The following topics will be covered:

- Obtaining and Loading Expression Data (RNA-seq)
- Understanding Data, Metadata and Design
- Data Exploration and Quality Control
- Data Filtering and Normalizations
- DESeq2: Input and Output
- Defining Contrasts and Calling Differential Genes
- Visualization and Sharing
- Notebooks: Documenting analysis
