# Poll Day 1
0.1 How will you keep track of the code, course material and notes during this course ?
   a) With a pen and paper.
   b) I will use the console, and save my session often !
   c) I will simply remember everything.
   d) An R notebook to easily store code and comments together.
   e) I will not keep track of the code, course material and notes during this course.

1.1. How do you get information about the current R-version and loaded packages
   a) summary()
   b) sessionInfo()
   c) getwd()
   d) installed.packages()

1.2. Did you manage to load DESeq2, tidyverse & pheatmap ?
   a) yes.
   b) no.

1.3. What is the median expression count in sample "BM_CTRL_3"?
   a) 520.3338
   b) 873.331
   c) 0
   d) NA

1.4. What is a factor in R?
   a) A numerical variable to be multiplied with another (e.g. scale factor)
   b) A categorical variable that can only assume specific values (e.g. treatment)
   c) A nuisance variable that is of no specific interest (e.g. batch)
   d) A brand of bicycles (developed and engineered to be the best in the world).

1.5. What is n from y_i = f(x_i) in our example ?
   a) number of genes
   b) number of samples
   c) total number of reads

1.6. You are planning an experiment with 3 treatment levels $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ and aim for 3 replicates each. Unfortunately, you can process at most 3 samples per day. So you'll need three days $(Z_1, Z_2, Z_3)$. How should you assign your samples to different treatments?

   (3 Figures)
   a) complete confounding
   b) completely randomized design
   c) randomized complete block design*

# Poll Day 2

2.1.  What should we do next ?

   a) PCA looks good, we can move on with the analysis.
   b) PCA shows a celltype swap in 2 samples. We should swap the labels before going forward.
   c) PCA shows a celltype swap in 2 samples. We should omit these samples from our dataset.
   d) PCA shows a celltype swap in 2 samples. We should talk to the sequencing facility and ask them to resequence.

2.2 How many samples and genes are left in the filtered data set ?

   a) 18, 30231
   b) 16, 27674
   c) 16, 27351
   d) 0, 0

2.3 What kind of distribution would be appropriate for this data ?

   a) The poisson distribution
   b) Not the poisson distribution

2.4 What does a positive log2 foldChange and a significant padj value reflect ?

   a) an upregulated gene in TG treated BM cells.
   b) an upregulated gene in TG treated JJ cells.
   c) an upregulated gene in DMSO treated BM cells.
   d) an upregulated gene in DMSO treated JJ cells.

# Poll day 3

3.1 What does the intercept value reflect ?

   a) The average gene counts for celltype JJ
   b) The average gene counts for celltype BM

3.2 What coefficients will we have when we specify ~condition as the design ?

   a) intercept, amiloride condition, DMSO condition, TG condition
   b) intercept, amiloride vs DMSO condition, TG vs DMSO condition
   c) intercept, DMSO vs amiloride condition, TG vs amiloride condition

3.3 What does the intercept value reflect ?

   a) The average gene counts for celltype BM
   b) The average gene counts for treatment amiloride
   c) The average gene counts for amiloride treated BM cells
   d) The average gene counts for dmso treated JJ cells

3.4 Is there a difference in specifying ~celltype * condition and ~celltype + condition + celltype:condition ?

   a) Yes
   b) No
   c) It depends

3.5 Given our contrast c('condition', 'TG', 'AMIL'), what would a significant positive foldchange correspond to ?

   a) Higher expression in TG-treated cells
   b) Higher expression in AMIL-treated cells
