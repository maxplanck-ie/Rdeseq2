## Day 2

## Day 3
3.1 Is there a difference in specifying ~celltype*condition and ~celltype + condition + celltype:condition ?
   a) Yes
   b) No
   c) Maybe

3.2 Given our design (~celltype*condition), what comparison do we look at by specifying results(dds, contrast = c("condition", "TG", "DMSO")) ?
   a) A comparison between TG-treated cells and DMSO-treated cells.
   b) A comparison between TG-treated BM cells and DMSO-treated BM cells.
   c) A comparison between TG-treated JJ cells and DMSO-treated JJ cells.
   d) A comparison between TG-treated JJ cells and DMSO-treated BM cells.

3.3 Given our contrast c('condition', 'TG', 'AMIL'), what would a (significant) positive foldchange correspond to?
   a) Higher expression in TG-treated BM cells
   b) Higher expression AMIL-treated BM cells
   c) Higher expression in TG- and AMIL-treated BM cells relative to DMSO.
