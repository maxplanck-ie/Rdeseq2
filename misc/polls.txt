# Poll Questions

## Day 1
1.1. How do you get information about the current R-version and loaded packages
   a) summary()
   b) sessionInfo()*
   c) getwd()

1.2. Who has successfully installed the packages

1.3. What is the median expression count in sample "BM_CTRL_3"?
   a) 520.3338
   b) 873.331
   c) 0*

1.4. What is a factor in R?
   a) A numerical variable to be multiplied with another (e.g. scale factor)
   b) A categorical variable that can only assume specific values (e.g. treatment)
   c) A nuisance variable that is of no specific interest (e.g. batch)

1.5. What is n from y_i = f(x_i) in our example ?
   a) number of genes
   b) number of samples*
   c) total number of reads

1.6. You are planning an experiment with 3 treatment levels $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ and aim for 3 replicates each. Unfortunately, you can process at most 3 samples per day. So you'll need three days $(Z_1, Z_2, Z_3)$. How should you assign your samples to different treatments?

   3 Figures:
   1. complete confounding
   2. completely randomized design
   3. randomized complete block design*

## Day 2
2.1 What do you think about this PCA plot? Does it need to be fixed? How would you do it?
   a) The PCA is correct by showing the current clustering of the samples. No fixing is needed
   b) The PCA is showing that there is a problem because our samples do not cluster by category. We need to go back and swap the 2 samples
   c) There is a mixup in the samples. We need to talk with the sequencing facility so that they change the samples and sequence again
   d) The PCA shows that there is a problem with our samples. We delete the data from our dataset

2.2 Notice the output - what does the 'mean' tell you, practically?
   a) The mean of each column helps to figure out if the libraries have the same size
   b) It shows that we have lots of zero counts
   c) It tells us the average number of counts for each sample

2.3 What properties can you attribute to RNA-seq data?
   a) Large number of discrete observations; high probability of finding a particular transcript; variance lower than mean
   b) Continuous distribution because of the very large number of observations; low probability of finding a particular transcript; variance higher than mean
   c) Large number of discrete observations; low probability of finding a particular transcript; variance lower than mean

2.4 What kind of distribution would you use for count data?
   a) Poisson distribution
   b) Binomial distribution
   c) Negative binomial distribution
   d) Normal distribution

2.5 Can the size factors be used as quality control? At what value of the size factors should you go back and look at your data?
   a) Yes. If one factor is either more than double or less than half the value of the average of factors
   b) No. If one factor is above 5 or bellow 0.5
   c) No. The values simply show the differences in library sizes and are used just to normalize the counts.
   d) Yes. Any large variation from the rest of the group should be investigated. Can mean that we have a bad sample that needs to be excluded.

## Day 3
3.1 What is the relation between the size factors and the values of the columns?
    a) Larger size factors correspond to the samples with higher sequencing depth.
    b) Larger size factors correspond to the samples with lower sequencing depth.
    c) Size factors are independent of the sequencing depth.

3.2 Is there a difference in specifying ~celltype*condition and ~celltype + condition + celltype:condition ?
   a) Yes
   b) No
   c) Maybe

3.3 Given our design (~celltype*condition), what comparison do we look at by specifying results(dds, contrast = c("condition", "TG", "DMSO")) ?
   a) A comparison between TG-treated cells and DMSO-treated cells.
   b) A comparison between TG-treated BM cells and DMSO-treated BM cells.
   c) A comparison between TG-treated JJ cells and DMSO-treated JJ cells.
   d) A comparison between TG-treated JJ cells and DMSO-treated BM cells.

3.4 Given our contrast c('condition', 'TG', 'AMIL'), what would a (significant) positive foldchange correspond to?
   a) Higher expression in TG-treated BM cells
   b) Higher expression AMIL-treated BM cells
   c) Higher expression in TG- and AMIL-treated BM cells relative to DMSO.
