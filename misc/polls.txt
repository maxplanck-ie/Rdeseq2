# Poll Questions

## Day 1
1.1. How do you get information about the current R-version and loaded packages
   a) summary()
   b) sessionInfo()*
   c) getwd()
   
1.2. Who has successfully installed the packages

1.3. What is the median expression count in sample "BM_CTRL_3"?
   a) 520.3338
   b) 873.331
   c) 0*  
   
1.4. What is a factor in R?
   a) A numerical variable to be multiplied with another (e.g. scale factor)
   b) A categorical variable that can only assume specific values (e.g. treatment)
   c) A nuisance variable that is of no specific interest (e.g. batch)

1.5. What is n from y_i = f(x_i) in our example ?
   a) number of genes  
   b) number of samples* 
   c) total number of reads
   
1.6. You are planning an experiment with 3 treatment levels $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ and aim for 3 replicates each. Unfortunately, you can process at most 3 samples per day. So you'll need three days $(Z_1, Z_2, Z_3)$. How should you assign your samples to different treatments?

   3 Figures:
   1. complete confounding
   2. completely randomized design
   3. randomized complete block design*

## Day 2

## Day 3
3.1 Is there a difference in specifying ~celltype*condition and ~celltype + condition + celltype:condition ?
   a) Yes
   b) No
   c) Maybe

3.2 Given our design (~celltype*condition), what comparison do we look at by specifying results(dds, contrast = c("condition", "TG", "DMSO")) ?
   a) A comparison between TG-treated cells and DMSO-treated cells.
   b) A comparison between TG-treated BM cells and DMSO-treated BM cells.
   c) A comparison between TG-treated JJ cells and DMSO-treated JJ cells.
   d) A comparison between TG-treated JJ cells and DMSO-treated BM cells.

3.3 Given our contrast c('condition', 'TG', 'AMIL'), what would a (significant) positive foldchange correspond to?
   a) Higher expression in TG-treated BM cells
   b) Higher expression AMIL-treated BM cells
   c) Higher expression in TG- and AMIL-treated BM cells relative to DMSO.
